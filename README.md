# Python Practice Projects

This repository contains simple Python projects and practice scripts I've created while learning and experimenting.  
These are small-scale projects, mostly for practice and fun, not production-ready apps.

## Project List

A command-line task manager that reads and writes tasks to a CSV file.
- Add, view, complete, and delete tasks.
